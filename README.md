# ðŸŽ« Support Ticket Priority Predictor
Predict the priority level of incoming support tickets using machine learning, helping teams triage and respond more efficiently.

# ðŸ“Š Project Overview
This project uses classification models to predict whether a support ticket is Low, Medium, or High priority based on features available at the time of ticket intake. Itâ€™s built to assist customer support teams in automating ticket triage and improving response times.

# ðŸ§  Models Used

Gradient Boosting Classifier which is Light Gradient Boosting Classifier (LGBMClassifier)

Each model is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and F1-score to ensure reliable performance.

# ðŸ“ˆ Key Features
Predictive modeling for ticket prioritization

Feature importance analysis

Evaluation with multiple metrics

Clean and modular code using scikit-learn
